This contest is open for Undergraduate, Post Graduate, and Ph.D. students.

The contest aims to create an opportunity for the students to showcase their skills, knowledge, and creativity in the domain of smart devices and/or smart systems. The various domains that are covered under the theme of this STUDENT CONTEST are small-scale sensors, MEMS, microfluidics, microelectronics, mechatronics, microsystems, etc.

The STUDENT CONTEST will be conducted in 3 stages:

Stage 1: The participants of the contest are expected to submit an abstract or a report of their ideas about the domains mentioned above. The abstract should contain the objective, methodology of implementation, and the expected deliverables with possible demonstrations. Those abstracts must to be submitted under the respective zones (North, South, East, West, and Central) through the registration form. The submitted abstracts will be evaluated based on merit, innovative content, demonstration ability and similar other factors.

The results of the shortlisted abstracts will be announced as per the dates mentioned in the brochure of STUDENT CONTEST event.

Stage 2: As mentioned in the evaluation process of Stage 1, ten teams from each zone will appear for the Stage 2. Out of those ten teams, five teams from each zone will be qualified trough the evaluation process of Stage 2 for appearing in the final event. In the evaluation process of Stage 2, each team is expected to build their initial model as submitted by their abstract. All the selected teams, who will clear the evaluation process of Stage 2, are eligible to claim a maximum of Rs. 5000 for their model building expenditure, which can be reimbursed against the submission of their GST bills.

After the completion of second round of evaluation through Stage 2, five selected teams from each zones will go to Stage 3, which is the final evaluation.
