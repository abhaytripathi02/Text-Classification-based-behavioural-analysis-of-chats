GSoC explained?

GSoC stands for Google Summer of Code. It is an annual global program sponsored by Google that invites university students to participate in open-source software development projects.

The program aims to connect students with mentors from various organizations to work on coding projects during the summer break.

To participate in GSoC, students apply to work on a project proposed by an open-source organization, and if selected, they receive a stipend for the summer to work on the project.

The program helps students gain experience in open-source software development and also provides valuable contributions to the open-source community.

Google Summer of Code has been running since 2005 and has helped thousands of students and open-source organizations around the world.

17/05/2023, 01:40 - +91 95554 58071: Hello community,

I wanted to know what's your opinion on this...
@917895212069 @everyone

I'm stuck with this dilemma in my mind.
As a second year undergrad, I'm currently learning advanced react and stuff, but seeing the current trend in development it makes me feel insecure that will I be able to make into big tech companies as a developers role, like there are so many people doing the same thing, how will I be able to make it. 
Should I change my field ie, should i go try ML and stuff....and so on.

Like i get these thoughts a lot, so what will you recommend me on this.
17/05/2023, 01:45 - +234 903 138 9842: First if it about you thinking your current field is saturated i.e people are much, I want you to have it in mind that people are also plenty there also...

Everywhere is saturated, no field is easy that is another thing
17/05/2023, 01:46 - +234 903 138 9842: I can't say if you should change your  field or not but am just trying to tell you what and what to consider before taking any decision of yours
17/05/2023, 01:46 - Cockroach: Dude!! First of all it is good to examine the things!! But don't underestimate urself  because u have potential to achieve the things also,  react always in trend just so don't worry about that, there are lots of job role except developer.. ..
17/05/2023, 01:52 - +91 78952 12069: There is heavy demand and space for every technology. If you want to explore other technologies, do that. But don't shift to other technologies thinking that they're more in demand in the industry. Learn and move forward with the technology that best interests you. You'll be able to get many opportunities on that. Web development is the trend, and ML as well. Continue with the one that you like the best. 
All the best ✨
17/05/2023, 01:55 - Cockroach: !
17/05/2023, 02:03 - +91 85274 12744: Bro I have tried ML. Only do it if you have interest in maths and statistics because it's less coding and more just maths lol. And don't worry about so many developers, the market is so vast for developers that you will get many opportunities. Don't fall into the notion that webdev is not worth it. If you have interest in ML and you can go and explore but right now, you have less time. Stick to what you have been doing is what I would advise.
17/05/2023, 02:14 - +91 95554 58071: Thank you @917895212069 @918839288078 @2349031389842 @918527412744  for you valuable replies 😊!!...

23/05/2023, 06:32 - +234 802 330 2683: Cyber security is very relevant you know everyday more datas and information are produced or discovered and most of those datas could cause crisis if mishandled or lost take for instance the database system of a company it contains all valuable information of that company so it means that the company will also need people to protect that database and that's where cyber securities come in
23/05/2023, 06:34 - +91 79745 59903: Ohk ty.
23/05/2023, 06:37 - +91 79745 59903: also Since ethical hacking is a subset of cyber security and I don't intend to fetch a job in cyber security domain  as I only pursue it as an interest. So should I go for ethical hacking or otherwise?
23/05/2023, 06:44 - +234 802 330 2683: I say do the full course on Cyber security why? I don't know how other countries roll but Nigeria is a country where you can't put all your eggs in one basket and if you read book you'd probably have read Rich Dad Poor Dad by Robert T Kiyosaki and he said that one found himself or herself unsuccessful because of one thing they failed to learn and then they end up saying "if I had learn this, if I had learn that" so in order for us to avoid all that I say we just learn to the fullest

23/05/2023, 16:26 - +91 81468 99951: I tried, it

No change

23/05/2023, 17:18 - +91 86194 63019: Branching creates a new branch and you push the changes in code to the new branch..

Now when you create the PR, you should be pushing it through a new branch so that it goes through the test cases and stuff in order to check whether the code you've pushed is working perfectly or not. 

Now let's assume you're pushing the code directly to the main branch and you've created a PR. Your code has some fault and the deployment team either has to deploy your code directly to the main branch(in order to check and as it has some fault, their production will go down) or they can close the PR without merging it.
23/05/2023, 17:39 - +91 85274 12744: Think of it like a timeline concept. There is the original timeline called "master". Now you get a device that can change the timeline, you use it now the timeline is changed but it created a new parallel timeline that is called branching. You can change anything in this new branch and it won't affect the main branch until you merge the new branch with the master branch.

28/05/2023, 20:42 - +91 93152 08698: Ye code dekhna :
#include <bits/stdc++.h>

int convert(int N,string &str)
{
    // Write your code here.
    int s=0;
    for(int i=N-1,j=0;i>=0,j<N;i--,j++)

        s=s+pow(2,i)*(str[j]);
    }
    return s;
}

Ye meine likha hai upar wala, jisse "wrong answer" aa raha hain output mei binary to decimal wale question mei.

Ye chatgpt ne likha hai neeche wala:

#include <bits/stdc++.h>

int convert(int N,string &str)
{
    // Write your code here.
    int s=0;
    for(int i=N-1,j=0;i>=0,j<N;i--,j++)
    {
        s=s+pow(2,i)*(str[j] - '0');
    }
    return s;
}

Is wali line mei -'0' kara hai bas aur code chal gaya to mujhe samajh nahi aa raha isse hota kya, batana isse hua kya actually?

  s=s+pow(2,i)*(str[j] - '0');

So You're having "7433" (say) not 7433
 Suppose You want to convert '5' to 5. So to do that Just simply do '5' - '0' , which means that 53 - 48 = 5 (ASCII Value of 0 is 48 , 1 is 49 and so on)

Hope it helped!!

So, as far as I've observed, lot of students are searching for online internships. What I've decided is that *everyday I'll be listing some genuine and good online internships, in a single LinkedIn post* from which you can apply directly in them. But *searching and getting info about online internships is a comparatively hard task so I will need the support of you all - in the form of comments, or sharing of my post for a better reach. No sort of personal profit is involved in this, but I need some support from your side, as collecting all this information takes lot of time and efforts.*

Also, if anyone is interested to help me out in this initiative, simply by helping increase the reach or sharing it with others, then you can DM me. 

*PS- If I will not see any sort of support from you all, I'll no longer continue this.*

Geetam - A Sanskrit word meaning “Geet” or song which have a very strong sense of something good, soothing, beautiful and extraordinary.

With geetam, we at provokedev.tech are planning to make a community which have something for everyone who is going to participate in that community at any point of time, from any domain and for anything.

We will be hosting multiple events like., contest, seminars, interactive session and much more with the help of our geetam college outreach community which maybe available at almost every single college of India by our 1st year. On the other hand, we will be also getting working professionals at this community to help other learn the stuffs they know better.


Somewhere, we will be promoting and conserving groups, ideas, thesis/philosophy and much more of every interest/skill with the help of provokedev.tech to help them be a better version of them and their knowledge with us. Creating an ecosystem like this requires a lot of people to work collaboratively and a lot of groups, companies which will be starting with us in this project gives a preference to people who have participates in geetam at any point of time regardless of their domain as in any org/team we need people from multiple domains.

This will be foster and create a vibrant, great and amazing Open Source Community where we can do much more than our capabilities. Almost every idea/project will be developed with Open Source Community first then will have a separate premium version which will be provided by the original authors of that idea/project and we will be helping them out everywhere not for anything but just to create a great ecosystem and a mixture of everything at the name of our firm as parent org. 

We personally believe there’s a lot to do with geetam and we are going to do that with you :)

Hi Mohit, an announcement has been made from Vlad, instructor of Git & GitHub For Beginners - Master Git and GitHub (2022).

Boom!

I’m so glad to let you know that my Best Seller Course - “Advanced C Programming Masterclass: Pointers & Memory in C” is now released & updated!

Since I’m very happy and inspired to see the process you’re making in my other courses.. And thanks for all of your support, feedback, and star ratings..!

I decided to give you, my dear students, this “advanced” course totally for free.

This is a Best-Seller and a “special edition” course covering Advanced C programming concepts - mainly including pointers (from zero to hero), memory addressing and physical representation (the bits and the bytes), pointers to functions, advanced concepts of structs, memory alignment, padding, packing, dynamic memory allocation, and so much more.

After completing this course you will gain plenty of new skills and knowledge that may improve your chances of getting a job position as a C Developer as well as increasing your chances to pass the exam (if you're still a student).

Is transparency only reason for it, or anything else??

Want to know community 's thoughts over this
30/06/2023, 09:59 - +91 81004 47535: Yeah transparency is a big reason, apart from that the users are able to own their assets and gain  control over them rather than the company. That's why web3 is known as user - owned internet.
30/06/2023, 11:23 - +91 82248 28926: Another reason is... It is immutable. So there is no chance of loss of data. Unlike web 2 where our data's fate is in the hands of server owners.

07/10/2023, 22:39 - +91 78957 12069: Hello everyone. 🙏
I wanted your suggestions on something. I'm thinking to start a 30 days series sort of thing. This will be mostly for placement perspective. I will be doing this on LinkedIn since almost everyone use it. 
Every week there will be- 
4 days -> 2 posts(one for internships, one for jobs)
1 day -> referral opportunities
1 day -> placement related material like important interview questions for specific companies, etc.
On Sunday -> reposting of all the important opportunities shared in that week.
Target - 250+ opportunities to be shared per week 

Please tell me your opinions if this will be useful for you. I will only be proceeding if some people will be supporting the initiative as this will take lot of time and research to curate openings and these things. I'll be gaining no sort of financial benefit or anything through it so I will need a little support from you all. So please share your opinion:)
08/10/2023, 07:31 - +91 6281 726 474: Didi, Referral Opportunities works only when someone already has a great profile and it's needs to be ranked in the top 50 applications among 1000 applications, right?
08/10/2023, 08:12 - +91 94780 74984: <Media omitted>
08/10/2023, 09:51 - +91 78957 12069: Not exactly. Obviously it needs to be suitable for the job role otherwise why will someone refer you. But not exactly top profile. You need to try asking a few employees to get referral because you get reply back from hardly 5 people if you text 100 people:)
08/10/2023, 10:07 - +91 6281 726 474: Didi, Employees ko Benefits milega if their referred candidates gets selected, So it's their best interest to refer as much as possible :)
08/10/2023, 10:09 - +91 78957 12069: It doesn't mean that they refer anyone without having any knowledge. 
Besides it's useless to run after referral, run after improving skills which will help you in every way.
08/10/2023, 11:56 - +91 94243 55123: Grateful for the memories, excited for what's to come 🤩
